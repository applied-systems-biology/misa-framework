      <title>Building on Linux</title>

      <description>This building guide was tested for Ubuntu 18.04 and 19.10. To build *.deb packages, you can alternatively use our Docker-based Linux build scripts. We also provide generic Linux build scripts that should work for any Linux distribution, given that the dependencies are installed.
Due to the differences between different Linux distributions, we cannot guarantee that the generic build script runs without error.
 Building the C++ framework MISA++ Core The core library requires at least GCC version 8 and the Boost libraries.</description>

      <title>Building on Windows Cygwin</title>
      <link>https://applied-systems-biology.github.io/misa-framework/cpp-framework/building/windows-cygwin/</link>

      <description>We tested building on Windows via the Cygwin64 environment.
Please note that the Visual Studio compiler is not supported due to missing OpenMP 3.x capabilities.
 We consider building on Windows experimental due to unexplained freezing of multi-threaded workloads if started from ImageJ (running directly within the command line does not show this behavior).
 Prerequisites Download and install Cygwin64. Please consider our Readme file for a list of required packages.</description>

      <title>Building on Windows MSYS2</title>
      <link>https://applied-systems-biology.github.io/misa-framework/cpp-framework/building/windows-msys2/</link>

      <description>Update: Due to the rolling release nature of MSYS2, the MSYS2 build process is currently broken. The Boost 1.70+ library that is provided by MSYS2 is incompatible with OME libraries due to a change in CMake targets. Please use our guide for Cygwin to build MISA++ on Windows.
 We tested building on Windows via the MSYS2 environment.
Please note that the Visual Studio compiler is not supported due to missing OpenMP 3.</description>
