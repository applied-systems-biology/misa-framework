# Requirements

This project requires Python 3 and various dependency libraries.
You can use `pip` to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

The program can be run with following command:

```bash
snakemake -j <num-threads> --config input=<input-directory> output=<output-directory>
```

The input directory must have following structure:

```
<input-directory>/<sample>/<input file>.tif
<input-directory>/voxel_sizes.json
```

There can be as many samples as required.

The `voxel_sizes.json` file must have following structure:

```json
{
    "<sample 0>" : { "xy" : 5.159, "z" : 5.0 },
    "<sample 1>" : { "xy" : 5.159, "z" : 5.0 }
}
```

The sample names in `voxel_sizes.json` correspond to the folder names in the input directory.
