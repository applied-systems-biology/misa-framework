MISA++ uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system (version 3.12.2) and is designed around
the GCC compiler. We tested compilation under GCC version 7.3.

Info: Newer versions than CMake 3.12.2 might have issues with compiling *OME files*.

If you want to use another compiler, check if it supports C++ 2017 or higher and
OpenMP 4.5 or higher. We only used OpenMP 3.x features, so using an older OpenMP
version might work.

You will also need following additional libraries:

| Library             | Version    | Notes                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boost               | 1.67       |                                                                         |
| SQLite              | 3          |                                                                         |
| OME files           | 0.5.0      | See https://www.openmicroscopy.org/ for download and build instructions |
| OpenCV              | 3.x or 4.x |                                                                         |
| JSON for Modern C++ | 3.5.0      | See https://github.com/nlohmann/json                                    |

The MISA++ libraries and applications we provide depend on each other:

Please make sure to build the dependencies the correct order.
